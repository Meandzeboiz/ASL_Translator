# ASL_Translator
This AI is trained to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) fingerspelling in static images. What sets it apart from the models it was based on is the custom dataset that is in simple terms two datasets combined. after training, the program should be able to reliably and consisently recognize letters, numbers and some special gestures such as space and delete, as well as detect when there is nothing onscreen. This is a complete program albeit a very simple and common project in the end. if I had more time I would have taken time to learn how to make it detect rapid ASL fingerspelling in live camera feed
as well as having it type out outputted letters, numbers spaces and delete letters on a separate screen document or notepad. this would make the program much more unique and practical as the program would work in real time and people interacting with the mute and deaf and see what they are "typing" in ASL.
